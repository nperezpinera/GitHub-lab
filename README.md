# GitHub-lab
This is a test of markdown. First of all, it allows for the creation of **bold** and _italic_ text formats. These can be used **_at the same time_**.
It also allows for headers of varying sizes:
# header 1
## header 2
### header 3
#### etc

These last two features can also be combined:
## _Italicised header 2_

URLs can be linked to text:
[The coconut crab is a massive crustacean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_crab)

Again, these features can be combined:
[The coconut crab really is a **massive** crustacean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_crab)
